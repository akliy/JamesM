# Roll your own toy UNIX-clone OS

I'm just following http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/.

The code should run fine under Ubuntu 13.04 though, I've had to hack a bit the
tutorial (mainly the bochs config).

# LICENSE
The linux-0.01/ directory has been downloaded at

probably under GPLv2.

Files in the src/ directory comes mostly from the tutorial (for each exception
the license header have been retained in the concerned files) so consider it
